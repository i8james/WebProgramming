                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <p>Over the course of my albeit short career I have worked on various projects and have worked in a variety of places.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Early stages: My first ever job was at Edge-works Climbing and Guiding as a youth instructor. After working there for two years that job taught me the skills to handle and work with people and in a dynamic ever changing office space. In my time working there I have added much to the curriculum and was promoted multiple times due to my talents as an educator and coach. Which is propelled by my outgoing personality and kind heart.</li>
                    <li>Project 2: A personal blog built with HTML and CSS.</li>
                    <li>Project 3: A Unity Engine game that I developed for fun.</li>
